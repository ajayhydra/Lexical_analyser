# Lexical_analyser
 lexical analyzer project is a crucial part of compiler design, responsible for converting source code 
into tokens, which are the basic building blocks like keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators. It 
uses pattern matching, often with regular expressions, to identify and classify these tokens. The 
lexer also detects and reports lexical errors, such as illegal characters, early in the compilation 
process. This transformation from raw code to structured tokens enables efficient and accurate 
parsing in subsequent stages of compilation.
